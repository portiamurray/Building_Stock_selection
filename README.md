# Building Stock Selection
This program is a multi-objective model that can be used to select the best building envelope and system updates for a building. Building types considered are single-family homes, multi-family homes, offices, schools, hospitals, restaurants, and shops. The building loads are simulated with the CESAR tool which is located in a separate repository. This tool optimizes the  building envelope interventions for 7 different types: no retrofit, roof retrofit, ground retrofit, facade retrofit, window retroit, facade and window retrofit, and a whole retrofit. Simultaneously, a heating system is selected. The System can choose to keep its current heating system at no cost, or it can choose to install an air source heat pump, solar thermal, PV, a ground source heat pump, a gas boiler, or a biomass boiler. Battery storage and thermal storage can also be used.

Two objective functions are established: a cost minimization and a CO2 minimization. Embodied emissions of building materials and installed heating systems are included in the calculation, as well as LCA values for electricity, natural gas, heating oil, and biomass. The epsilon-constraint method is then used to solve for Pareto optimal solutions. A cost optimization with a CO2 limit can also be simulated. This 10 test buildings are simulated for each single-family, multi-family, and offices here. but over 500 buildings for each type were simulated in total.
